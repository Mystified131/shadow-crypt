# shadow-crypt
A python program that encrypts text and saves it as a text file, or decrypts it from the text file.

This python code allows you to input text. It encrypts and saves the text in a text file called "ShadowCodeOut", saved in the same directory. It can also decrypt identically encrypted messages from the same file. The encryption key changes with each cipher creation.
